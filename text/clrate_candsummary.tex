In the previous chapter we addressed the type of all 29 candidates
thought to be SNe. However only the cluster-member SNe~Ia are of
interest for this chapter. There are six ``secure''
cluster-member SNe~Ia, and two ``probable'' SNe~Ia, for a total of
eight. In addition, SCP06E12 is a ``plausible'' SN~Ia and may be a
cluster member. Two other candidates, SCP06N32 and SCP06M50, cannot be
definitively ruled out as cluster-member SNe~Ia, but are quite
unlikely for reasons outlined above. We take eight cluster SNe~Ia as
the most likely total. It is unlikely that {\it both} of the
``probable'' SNe~Ia are in fact SNe~CC. We therefore assign a
classification error of $^{+0.0}_{-0.5}$ for each of these, resulting
in a lower limit of seven cluster-member SNe~Ia. There is a good
chance that SCP06E12 is a cluster-member SN~Ia, while there is only a
small chance that SCP06N32 and SCP06M50 are either cluster SNe~Ia. For
these three candidates together, we assign a classification error of
$^{+1}_{-0}$, for an upper limit of nine. Thus, $8 \pm 1$ is the total
number of observed cluster SNe~Ia, including classification uncertainty.
